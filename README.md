SemesterProject_Backpropagation
===============================

Made this code in my fifth semester as an extra project while studying Soft Computing(Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Genetic Algos).
It is a rudimentary code and was implemented to better understand the underlying concepts. Input and Output files are attached.
Input Parameters include:Run Order, Speed(rpm) and Feed(ipr) while making a tool in the lathe machine.
Output Parameter: Surface Finish Value(micrometers).

Data was obtained from the Mechanical Department from PhD study of a Professor.
